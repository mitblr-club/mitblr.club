## Our Aim

Every institution has multiple student clubs, each aspiring to have their own
digital presence. A key component of any digital presence is a **centralized
hub** that expresses the vision and dash of the club.

The scale and scope of this hub varies with the requirements of the club/chapter
and their community. However, there are challenges from both financial and human
resource perspectives that constrain the club from building this on their own.

Hence, **mitblr.club** aims to provide student communities with the relevant
technologies to kickstart their own social space on the internet.

## Our Solution

The problem we’re trying to address is a flexible one, creating the need for a
dynamic solution. Each club has a requirement based on their own scale and
budget. To ensure the solution we offer is one that can be of assistance to all
clubs, we have designed a three-tier system.

### Tier 1: Custom Domain

We are offering a domain of the form <code>{"{club_name}"}.mitblr.club</code>,
to each club in the college, free of cost. The objective of this tier is to
relieve clubs from using their own budget for building their digital presence,
enabling them to use it for events and projects as they wish.

> If clubs/chapters are planning to host their own sites and require web
> analytics and/or image optimization, we recommend having their own account on
> a relevant hosting platform and ask us for a redirect domain. For more
> information, see [Technical Information](#technical-information).

### Tier 2: "Linked List" System

This tier is for clubs/chapters that do not require a fully-fledged website, but
could benefit from a system like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) that has all
their links in one place.

Our _\*cough\*_ **"Linked List" project** allows student clubs to have a central
hub for all their social media handles, GitHub organisations, and any other link
that is relevant to the club in a visual format that speaks about the club’s
vision and goals.

A working demo of this tier can be found
[here](https://linkedlist.mitblr.club/).

### Tier 3: Fully Custom Template

This tier is a fully-fledged, mobile responsive website template (with **dark
mode**!) that can be used by clubs that do not have the time or resources to
build their own site.

![Template Home Page](/demo-template.png)

The site also has pages for the club's **blogs** and **events** to create a
sense of community. Here, the logistics/operations team of the club can add,
delete, order and even set featured events from where students can directly
access the registration forms.

![Events Demo](/demo-events.png)

All content is edited and managed on [Notion](https://notion.so), so that the
content is displayed on the site just as expected by the core committee. Since
the platform is based on a **no-code approach**, editing content doesn't require
touching a single line of HTML and all site configuration is done through simple
JSON files.

> Clubs can choose the tier of their choice based on their requirements. Each
> tier comes with all products that are mentioned in the lower tiers as well.
> For instance, Tier 2 also comes with the domain given by Tier 1.

## Working with Student Welfare

**mitblr.club** works directly in unison with the Student Welfare of MIT
Bengaluru - thus mandating that all clubs/chapters **must pick one of the tiers
offered**. This is to ensure uniform domain names, allowing students to easily
visit the website of the club of their choice.

## Technical Information

- All websites have been built using [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/), A React
  framework with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
  [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/), and
  [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.
- We host our **Tier 2** and **Tier 3** sites on
  [Vercel's Pro Plan](https://vercel.com/pricing), which allows for secure team
  collaboration and higher scalability. Since their image optimization feature
  is still limited in this plan, it is reserved for use on **mitblr.club**'s own
  sites.
- All content for events and blogs is handled through **Notion's "Database
  Tables"**, which hold the page content and all its corresponding attributes.
  Each club/chapter can freely maintain admin access and hold rights to their
  own content.
- We fetch data from Notion using Splitbee's
  [notion-api-worker](https://github.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker), which is
  then displayed using their lightweight
  [react-notion](https://react-notion.com/) library.
- All of our projects are open-source, and the source code is available on
  [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/mitblr-club).
